            <p class="lead">
                This page is a window into how I approach product problems: how I reason,
                make trade-offs, and work with people when the path forward isn’t obvious.

            <h2>Product Philosophy</h2>
            <p>
                Great products live at the intersection of <strong>empathy</strong>,
                <strong>strategy</strong>, and <strong>technical feasibility</strong>.
                I believe execution without strategy is noise, and strategy without
                execution is theory. The real work happens when both move together.
            </p>

            <h2>My Default Approach</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Start with real user pain, not assumptions</li>
                <li>Define success and failure before proposing solutions</li>
                <li>Optimize early for learning, not perfection</li>
                <li>Ship clarity, not complexity</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Trade-offs I Take Seriously</h2>
            <p>
                I say no to features that increase cognitive load, timelines that burn
                teams out, and metrics that look impressive but don’t reflect real value.
                Sustainable progress matters more than short-term wins.

            <h2>Working Experience</h2>

            <ul class="principles">
                <li>
                    <strong>Calm in ambiguity</strong>
                    <span>I create structure when problems are unclear and help teams move forward with
                        confidence.</span>
                </li>

                <li>
                    <strong>Direct, but kind</strong>
                    <span>I value honest conversations, early feedback, and clarity without ego.</span>
                </li>

                <li>
                    <strong>Opinionated, not stubborn</strong>
                    <span>I bring a strong point of view and change course when better evidence appears.</span>
                </li>

                <li>
                    <strong>Systems thinker</strong>
                    <span>I zoom out to understand how decisions affect users, teams, and operations.</span>
                </li>

                <li>
                    <strong>Human + technical</strong>
                    <span>I translate between business goals, user needs, and engineering realities.</span>
                </li>
            </ul>
