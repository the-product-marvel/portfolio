# 👋🏽 Hey, I’m <!-- <span style="background: linear-gradient(90deg, #ce9c9c /*#ffffff*/); -webkit-background-clip: text; color: transparent;"> --> Maureen</span>! 😃

## 🌍 <!-- <span style="background: linear-gradient(90deg, #ce9c9c); -webkit-background-clip: text; color: transparent;"> --> Product Manager & Technology Leader</span>  
**Automation • Cloud • Fintech • Strategy**

I build **human-centered digital products** where **strategy**, **design**, and **engineering** shake hands, and complex ideas meet simple, intuitive execution. 

Think of me as a **Swiss-Army-Knife leader** who thrives in the messy middle: I bring the right tools to cut through complexity, bring clarity to chaos, and turn *“what if?”* into *“it’s live!”*
